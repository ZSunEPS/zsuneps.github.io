Howdy, thanks for stopping by! 👋

I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://geogeo.tamu.edu/">Department of Geology and Geophysics, Texas A&M University</a> under supervison of [Dr. Ethan Grossman](https://geogeo.tamu.edu/people/profiles/faculty/grossmanethan.html). My research interests are the kinetics and atomistic mechanism of carbonate clumped isotope (∆<sub>47</sub>) bond reordering, reconstruction of basin thermal history and evolution of paleoclimate. Approaches in my projects involve both experimental work and physical-chemical modeling.
